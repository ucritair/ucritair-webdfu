# Version v0-0-15-77

**Source Commit:** `1e5055c` (Based on `1e5055cb1e1a54e314bc67c0893563f8cc24ace2` in `ucritair-firmware`)
**Build Date:** 2025-04-30 14:22:34 CDT

## Changes

* 1e5055c revert so we do not update the eink when we come back from sleep - we likely do not have sensor data yet. This is a hack to fix an issue. In the future we shoudl sense if we came back from power off or sleep and update appropriately
